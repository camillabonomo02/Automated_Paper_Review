    "In order to develop and evaluate our parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for automated peer review, we first examined the structure of the dataset derived from the *TP 2017 Conference* peer review records. Each entry consists of a paper (title and abstract) and one or more human-written reviews, which include qualitative feedback and numeric metadata such as rating, confidence, and decision. Understanding the basic characteristics of this dataset is crucial: it informs tokenization choices, maximum sequence lengths, and ultimately the feasibility of training resource-constrained large language models (LLMs) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).\n",
    "These descriptive statistics provide insights into the expected input/output lengths, highlighting potential challenges in balancing completeness of context with computational efficiency."
